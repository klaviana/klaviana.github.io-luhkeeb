        <p> &emsp; Having spent 4 years working as a summer camp counselor for 10 & 11 year olds, Kee was tasked each week with playing the infamous Lucky Baldwin, a business magnate whose nearby house burned down in a tragic fire — or so we thought. Back from the dead, Baldwin was kidnapped and held hostage by robber barons until the kids found the hideout and rescued him. The nickname Lucky B stuck around, and, as his music career blossomed, eventually transformed into the amorphous, staccato Luh Kee b. </p>
            <br />
        <p> &emsp; LKb’s music largely draws on the influences of modern pop, hip hop, & R&B. Working with legendary mastering engineer Brian Gardner, who mastered the likes of Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city, Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter III, and Beyoncé's B’day, b learned the details of what goes into making timeless records. Kee produces, mixes, and records their own music, having obtained a holistic audio engineering education at Stanford CCRMA. She frequently codes her own plug-ins and tinkers with analog gear, reaching for a unique sonic footprint.</p>
            <br />
        <p> &emsp; Luh Kee b’s background as a jazz pianist also works its way into their music, frequently opting for complex arrangements and out-of-the box harmonic decisions, and unafraid to explore, bend, and merge different genres. Nonetheless b’s songs usually feature catchy pop melodies that attract a wide-ranging audience. Based out of Hartford, CT, Luh Kee b has spent significant time in Nashville, TN and the California Bay Area. </p>
